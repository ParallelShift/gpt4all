what a convoluted way to try and get in to a not so public splattering on the gpt4all pages chat!
im stuart, they call me mac as in macguyver.  i have been in to tech since aged 8 and now hitting 45 this year and this whole AGI scene has me pumped.

i have spent the last 20 years in IT and Tech so believe me when i tell you that going to this length to say hi is not the norm.

what i noticed was that reading your replies and text that you seem to be of the same mind and i wondered what your interest is if its professional or amateur etc 
and if you have found a distinct lack of friends in the scene either due to most people having no clue or just the fact that its all relatively new to some people 
even though others have had eyes on ML for a decade.

i have now spent more than 20 hours and cannot compile this damn code either.

i wondered if you would perhaps have the time to confer on this one time.

i think my problem may be that i installed all the prereqs for compile of UE5 from source so i have a lot of shit on my system that may confuse things in the path.

i am not familiar with qt creator or v studio 2022 but it makes perfect sense what you said.

you try to compile or build using the community qt creator then migrate the files to the 2022 ide or you simply tell QT to use vs 2022?

i sopecifically read somewhere about NOT using or deselecting MSVC which is how you said you got it to work.

anyway, nice to meet you and thanks for the hekp over there.  feel free to ignore this pull request.
i simply wanted to reach out since i think in these new times with this new technology we could all do with 
finding new friends like the ones we had when we were 8 and first imagined AI talking androids haha.

drop something in to macguyversmusic@gmail thats also my reddit handle.
maybe we can dm through reddit for a convo at some point.

i will remove this in a couple of days

Mac
